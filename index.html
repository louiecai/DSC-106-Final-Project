    <div>As we examine the airbnb dataset for various European cities, we can discern some fascinating differences in
      the way tourists behave and what they prefer when it comes to their airbnb experience.</div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h3>Plot 1:</h3>

      <div id="q1"></div>
      <h4>Plot:</h4>
      <div class="center_plot">
        <select id="q1_button"></select>
      </div>
      <div id="q1_plot" class="center_plot"></div>
      <br />
      <div>We start with the scatter plot, which shows the distance from the city center vs. the total price of the
        listings. Interestingly, we see no correlation between these two variables, suggesting that tourists are willing
        to pay similar prices for listings located at different distances from the city center.</div>
      <br />
      <div>
        Choice of color scheme: nothing special, just wanted to make the plot look a little more interesting. I used the
        same color for each city in plot 1 and 2 so that the reader can easily associate the cities with their
        corresponding colors.

        Moving on to the guest satisfaction ratings, we can see a clear winner among the cities: Athens. With an
        outstanding rating of 95, it seems that the Greek capital is winning over the hearts of tourists more than any
        other city in our dataset. London, on the other hand, falls behind with a rating of only 90.75, indicating that
        there is room for improvement in the city's airbnb offerings.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>
        Choice of color scheme: I used the same color scheme as in plot 1, so that the reader can easily associate the
        cities with their corresponding colors.

        When it comes to cleanliness ratings, we can see from the stacked bar plot that shared rooms have the greatest
        deviation in each city. This suggests that there may be a lack of consistency in the cleaning standards across
        shared rooms, which could be a cause of concern for potential guests. For example, Budapest has a average
        cleanliness rating of 9.6 for shared rooms, whereas Vienna has a rating of 8.14. This could be a cause for
        concern for potential guests.

      <div>
        Choice of color scheme: these colors are used to distinguish the different types of rooms. They are different so
        that the reader can easily distinguish between the different types of rooms.

      <h3>Plot 4:</h3>

        However, the distribution of apartments and entire homes among the cities seems to be a significant deciding
        factor for tourists. As the choropleth shows, Athens has the highest percentage of apartments and entire homes,
        whereas Barcelona has the lowest. This suggests that tourists visiting Athens may prefer to have a more private
        experience, whereas those visiting Barcelona may be more inclined to explore the city from a local's perspective
        by staying in other types of accommodations.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>
        Choice of color scheme: I used a sequential color scheme to show the percentage of apartments and entire
        homes. The colors are different so that the reader can easily distinguish between the different types of rooms.

      <h3>Plot 5:</h3>

      <div id="q5"></div>
      <h4>Plot:</h4>
      <div class="center_plot">
        <select id="q5_button"></select>
      </div>
      <div id="q5_plot" class="center_plot">
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>
        Lastly, we come to the box plot that shows the distance to the nearest subway station for each city. We see that
        Barcelona has the shortest distance, while Athens has the longest. This may indicate that tourists visiting
        Barcelona are more likely to use public transportation, whereas those visiting Athens may prefer to walk or use
        other modes of transportation.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>
        Choice of color scheme: same color scheme as in plot 1 and 2, so that the reader can easily associate the cities
